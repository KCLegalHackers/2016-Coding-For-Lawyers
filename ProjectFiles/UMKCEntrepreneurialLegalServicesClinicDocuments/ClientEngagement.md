Re:  Agreement for Legal Services

Dear[mX] [clientName]:

You have asked the UMKC Entrepreneurial Legal Services Clinic (the “Clinic”) to provide you with specific legal services in the matter described below.  This letter will confirm our discussion with you regarding your engagement of the Clinic and will describe the basis on which the Clinic shall provide limited services to you.

Accordingly, we submit for your approval the following provisions governing the subject engagement.  If you are in agreement, please sign the enclosed copy of this letter in the space provided below and return it to the undersigned at the above address.  If you have any questions about any aspect of this letter, or if you would like to discuss possible modifications, please call.

1.	Client; Scope of Engagement

Based on our conversations to date, we understand the following:

You wish to establish a business providing [clientBusinessDescription].  You wish to establish an entity from which to provide these services and others.  You seek (i) our advice about what entity form is optimal for your activities (“Choice of Entity Analysis); and (ii) assistance with the preparation and filing (with you paying the filing fee) of organizational documents for an entity suitable for business type (“Entity Formation”).  

 (a)    Client.  The Clinic’s client in respect of the Agreed Services will be you, Clientname.

            (b)   Agreed Services.  The Clinic will represent you, in accordance with the terms of this engagement letter (as the same may be amended from time to time with the agreement of all parties), only with respect to specified services that we mutually agree shall be performed by the Clinic (“Agreed Services”).  At this point, the only Agreed Services are the following: (i) Choice of Entity Analysis; and (ii) Entity Formation.

The Clinic has not agreed to provide you with any services other than such Agreed Services.  For instance, we are not agreeing to assist you with your customer contracts or independent contractor agreements, nor a review of your website or its content.  If the Clinic accepted those tasks, they would be the subjects of a second engagement letter similar to this one.  

(c)     Student Involvement.  You understand, agree and consent that the Clinic legal services shall be provided primarily by law students, supervised by one or more licensed attorneys.

2.	Fees and Expenses.  

		The Clinic is providing the Agreed Services without charge to you for such services.  However, you are responsible for all expenses incurred by the Clinic on your behalf in the course of providing the Agreed Services to the extent such expenses are described to you and approved by you.    The Clinic will not be required to incur any out-of-pocket expenses on your behalf, but may choose to do so for convenience with respect to such items as photocopying, delivery charges, long-distance telephone, computerized research and search charges and postage.  If the Clinic intends to pay such expenses and be reimbursed by you, the Clinic will first inform you of the estimated cost and ask for your approval and, if such approval is given, you will then be obligated to provide reimbursement to the Clinic promptly after receiving a statement itemizing such expenses.

3.	Billing.    

	In the event you do approve the Clinic incurring expenses on your behalf, the Clinic will thereafter bill you on a monthly basis for those expenses.  The Clinic will itemize separately charges for items such as photocopying, messenger and delivery service, computerized research, long-distance telephone and telecopy, and search fees.  The Clinic shall have the option to have any or all third party expenses billed directly to you or have you pay all such expenses yourself.  For example, the Clinic will not pay filing fees required by governmental authorities and you will need to pay those directly.   Reimbursement for any approved expenses that are paid by the Clinic on your behalf will be due promptly upon your receipt of the Clinic’s statement.  If any statement regarding your obligation to reimburse us for such expenses remains unpaid for more than 45 days, the Clinic may cease performing services for you.

4.	Conflicts/Confidentiality.

It is possible that some of the Clinic’s present or future clients or organizations that have a relationship with the Clinic or its personnel will have disputes with you (or your affiliates) during the time that the Clinic is representing you.  Therefore, the Clinic asks that you agree that the Clinic may maintain such relationships, and may continue to represent or undertake to represent existing or new clients in those matters that are not substantially related to the Clinic’s work for you, even if the interests of such organizations or clients in those other matters are directly adverse to you (or its affiliates).  The Clinic agrees, however, that your prospective consent to conflicting representation contained in the preceding sentence shall not apply in any instance where, as the result of the Clinic’s representation of you, the Clinic has obtained sensitive, proprietary or other confidential information of a non-public nature that, if known to any such other client of the Clinic, could be used in any such other matter by such client to the material disadvantage of you (or its affiliates).

5.	E-Mail Communications.

E-mail has become a frequent and efficient means of communication between lawyers and clients, and the Clinic would be happy to communicate with you via e-mail.  However, the Clinic would like to alert you to certain risks that may accompany the use of e-mail.  The principal risks to the use of e-mail are that the message could be intercepted by a third party and that the attorney-client privilege could be impaired.  An e-mail message may be intercepted at different stages, including while traveling from the sender to the recipient.  A third party could also obtain the e-mail from a computer or computer network.  Further, many computer systems copy messages and store them in multiple off-site locations as part of their backup systems, making the messages potentially accessible to others.  By signing below, you are acknowledging that you are satisfied that the risks described above are acceptable for e-mail communication with the Clinic and are authorizing us to communicate with you via e-mail notwithstanding such risks. Accessibility to e-mail by others, including family members and employers or employees, may infringe on your privacy and could impair the attorney-client privilege.   If you do not wish to authorize such use of e-mail, please let us know and we will modify this engagement letter accordingly.  We note that if the sensitive nature of a particular communication or the possibility of interception warrants a different means of communication, then we can endeavor to arrange for password protection or another means of communication, at your direction.  Thus, if you do authorize us to correspond with you via e-mail, in order to protect the privacy of your e-mail and to endeavor to preserve the attorney-client privilege for the Clinic’s communications with you, please provide us with the e-mail address of an account that is accessible only by you.  

6.	Withdrawal.

You may terminate the engagement contemplated hereby at any time by so notifying the Clinic in writing.  The Clinic may withdraw from this engagement (i) if you fail to fulfill your obligations under this agreement, including your obligation to pay expenses or to respond within a reasonable time, (ii) as permitted or required under any law, applicable standards of professional conduct or rules of court, or (iii) upon the Clinic’s reasonable notice to you (with or without cause).  The Clinic’s representation of you shall also terminate upon the completion of the Agreed Services.  Any termination of the Clinic’s services will not affect your responsibility for payment of outstanding statements and accrued expenses incurred before termination or incurred thereafter in connection with an orderly transition of the matter.  

As a general rule, we do not keep any of your original documents, except as are needed in connection with our Agreed Services.  Upon termination, any property and original papers we may have in our possession will be returned to you and the Clinic shall keep no copies of your records or documents, except to the extent the Clinic, in its sole discretion, decides to maintain a file for future reference.  Even so, as a general rule, we destroy our client files after five (5) years after completion of services.  If, at the conclusion of your case, you believe we have anything you want returned, please ask at that time.

Please call me if you have any questions or comments during the course of our representation.  If this is acceptable to you, please sign and return the duplicate copy of the last page of this letter.  For your convenience we are providing a self-addressed, stamped envelope (but ask that you please add postage.) 

		Respectfully,

UMKC ENTREPRENEURIAL LEGAL SERVICES CLINIC
