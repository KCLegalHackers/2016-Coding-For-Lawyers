###Re:     Management and Entity Maintenance Issues for [entityName] (your “Owner’s Manual”)

OFFICIAL BUSINESS RECORDS
The following documents, which we prepared for you, are the initial documents for your official business record.  As you operate your business over time, there will be other documents that you should add to this, generally in chronological order.   We attach:
 
a.	Work Completed 


These documents, and others that you add, should be kept as part of your official records at your principal office that, per your instructions, is [clientAddress].  Additional documents you should retain as they are created include your tax filings, amendments to Articles of Organization or Operating Agreement, action resolutions (sample enclosed), annual reports and other filings with governmental offices.  Please refer to your Operating Agreement on record keeping issues at Article V.  Please also note the entity number(s) given the Company by the office(s) of the Secretary of State of [clientState] listed on your certificate [entityNumber].  Use this number in all correspondence with the [clientState] Secretary of State.  

	The information that follows is designed to provide you with some general guidance as you proceed with operation of your Company.  All descriptions of legal and tax matters set for the below are based on current laws, which are subject to change.

Periodic Filings
Under state and federal laws your business is required to make certain filings with governmental agencies.  

1.  INCOME AND EARNING TAXES:  For taxes you may need to file some or all of the forms listed as a, through d, below.  Please remember that, since your business has a limited history so far, we have not and will not make any judgments concerning the tax characterization your income will have.  That is, we have ventured no opinions (for income or earning taxation or other purposes) about whether it is ordinary income or capital gains income, whether it is active or passive income, or earned or other income.  These judgments may be necessary to determine which forms you are required to file, and how taxes are computed.  This is why we strongly urge you to retain the services of an accountant or tax professional (if you have not already done so) to advise you on an on-going basis, and possibly prepare your tax returns.  Please rely on the advice of that tax professional on which forms you must file, and what characterization your income assumes.

a.	Federal Schedule C and your personal form 1040:  Because your Company is a “pass through” entity (not taxed as a separate taxpayer), these forms will report the income and expenses of the Company and assesses the tax on you, the individual owner, only.

b.	State Return: You will also probably be required to file a state income tax return for [state] as your state of residence, and possibly other states in which you do business.  Please consult your tax professional on which states require you to file a return.

c.	Kansas City Earnings Tax:  The City of Kansas City, Missouri, assesses a one percent earnings tax on gross income earned either inside the city or by residents of the city.  If at some point you relocate to or “do business in” Kansas City, Missouri, you may be required to pay this tax.  Please consult your tax professional on this question.  

d.	Estimated Tax:  You may be required to file and pay a quarterly estimated income tax for self-employment income from your business, with both federal, state, and possibly city taxing authorities.  These are generally due in April, June, September, and January for the calendar tax year in which taxes are due the following April 15th.  For guidelines on this responsibility, we suggest you consult your accountant, and Internal Revenue Service Publication 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax (available at the website www.IRS.gov or at local tax offices. 

You recall that we may have discussed some of these forms and filings that were required.  Many business people, especially when first beginning, find it convenient to ask a tax professional to prepare their taxes.  While you may not suffer the “phobia” of tax forms that many of us do, you, too, may find hiring a tax preparer is a more efficient use of your time.    

2.   PAYROLL TAXES:  Using the services of an accountant or at least a paycheck service is especially worthy of serious consideration if and when you hire employees. Employers have many legal responsibilities, for both tax and non-tax purposes; they must withhold income and payroll taxes (for Social Security and Medicare, for instance) which must be remitted periodically to taxing authorities.  Business people may be held personally liable for failure to timely remit these amounts, despite the existence of your limited liability entity.  Several firms offer a cost-effective way to handle these responsibilities.  Just a few of the other legal responsibilities of employers are dictated by such statutes as Wage and Hour, Workers’ Compensation, Employment Discrimination, Unemployment Insurance, and Child Labor laws.  You should consult with your accountant and attorney about these responsibilities when the time comes.

3.   FORM 1099:  For independent contractors who you pay $600 or more within the calendar year you will need to send Copy B of form 1099 MISC to the recipient stating the total amount paid, by February 1 of each year.  Send Copy A to the Internal Revenue Service by March 1.

4.  FRANCHISE TAX AND ANNUAL REPORTS:  Under current Missouri law a Missouri limited liability company is not required to file an annual report to its state of formation.  If and when the Company becomes registered to do business in Kansas, it will be required to file an Annual Report with the Kansas Secretary of State. This report is required of limited liability companies and certain other business entities in Kansas, and requires the payment of a franchise fee.  Kansas also requires the payment of a franchise tax by Companies with more than $1,000,000 of assets in Kansas.  The annual report is generally due on April 15th of each year.  Often, accountants include the completion and filing of these reports as a service included in your tax return preparation.  You can check the status of your Annual Report and file the Annual Report at the Kansas Secretary of State’s Website at www.kssos.org.  
At this time, Missouri neither requires an annual report nor imposes a franchise tax on limited liability companies.

5.   CHANGES IN AGENT OR ADDRESS:  One purpose of the Annual Report is to confirm the identity and address of the company’s resident agent. However, anytime your resident agent or registered office address change, state law requires that you file the appropriate form notifying the Secretary of State’s Office of the change.
	
	6.   BUSINESS PERSONAL PROPERTY TAX:  You are required to file a Commercial Personal Property Statement with the county appraiser’s office by March 15 for property owned on January 1 of that year.  The tax is then assessed and one half is due on December 20 and the other half on May 10.  




LICENSE AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

    	 Generally, an Occupational License is required for businesses doing business within the municipal corporate limits of Kansas City, Missouri, which is issued by the city Finance Department (816-513-1135).  There are some exceptions to this requirement (for instance, most professionals like attorneys, doctors, dentists, etc.)  If and when you venture into the city of Kansas City, you will have to investigate your obligation to fulfill this requirement.  We suggest you begin by calling the Kansas City Finance Department.  Please note we have not researched whether your business activity would be considered “doing business in” Kansas City for the purposes of this occupational license, and we are not rendering any legal opinion in that regard.  We only wish to alert you to the fact that you will need to determine if your business is required to do so.  You should ask the Finance Department, or your next legal counsel when the time comes.

While this memo is concluding your engagement of our Clinic, your need for legal advice and guidance, as you know, is not ending.  As you operate your business you will undoubtedly encounter legal issues that you will need to resolve.   We encourage you to “shop around” for an attorney or law firm with whom you are comfortable.  Many excellent, smaller firms charge reasonable fees for their services.  Maintaining a continuing relationship with a firm can help guarantee the success of your business enterprises.  
BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS AND Signing Documents
Transactions should be carried out in the name of the limited liability company.  Your signature on contracts should, for example, appear as:
[entityName]
By______________________
[clientName], [clientTitle]
Since you are the only Member, business decisions for your Company will be relatively easy.  However, you should record major decisions in writing.  We are enclosing a sample document that you might use for those decisions.    

Supplies and services should be requested in the name of “[entityName].”  To help preserve your limited liability, and reduce the chances that you could be held personally responsible for business debts, you need to be careful to transact business in the name of the company and respect other business formalities.  Maintain your business bank account, for instance, separately from your personal ones.  Most vendors of goods and services will probably be willing to deal with the LLC.  Occasionally one might insist on a personal guaranty (for instance, most commercial lenders).  



Admitting Additional OR TRANSFERS TO OTHER Members

	You will also recall that we emphasized that your Operating Agreement was specifically crafted for you, as the only owner of this Company.  Amendment to your Operating Agreement is allowed pursuant to Section 8.1.  However, if at any time you think about accepting any new members you will probably need an entirely new Operating Agreement.   For instance, you and other members will want to specify in writing exactly what each of you is contributing in the way of money or property of value; what each of you is entitled to receive in the way of distributions of profits; what is expected of each of you in the form of services to the company; who will have the authority to bind the company; how property and money will be distributed at liquidation; and what transfers are permitted by members.  Most owners will want to be able to control who their co-owners are so transfers will generally be prohibited, with perhaps at least a right of first refusal by other members in the event one owner wants to withdraw from the business.

We reiterate, BEFORE YOU ACCEPT ANY NEW MEMBERS, in addition to considering these provisions, you should consult an attorney as to the implications of that action and what necessary or advisable revisions should be made to the Company’s organizational documents.   

Our Clinic’s work for you is now concluded.  However, your need for legal advice and guidance, as you know, is not ending.  As you operate your business you with likely encounter legal issues that you will need to resolve.  We encourage you to indentify one or more attorneys or law firms with whom you are comfortable.  Maintaining a continuing relationship with qualified legal counsel can help guarantee the success of your business enterprises.  We thus urge you to continue to consult as needed with the attorneys, and also accountants of your choice to ensure that you operate your business in full compliance with the law and in a manner best calculated to assure your success.  We thank you for calling upon us to assist you, and wish you all the success in your endeavors.
